## K8S Jobs
The Job concept in Kubernetes (K8S) is ill conceived.

It assumes that a job runs to completion and that is it. A Job cannot be re-run.

This means that to run a job again it needs to be deleted and defined / run again.

So if a Job needs to be scheduled from another (external) scheduler it must be deleted and redefined.

This fact means the K8S Job concept does not allow for the concept to integrate well with popular enterprise solutions.
