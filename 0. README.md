# Python ETL Explore

A place to explore using Python for ETl.

## Overview

When hosted in Linux Docker containers, Python is a valid and reliable choice for ETL work loads.

## Why?

Python is a popular choice for data processing. Much progress has been made to raise Python to a place
where it it has become the languge of choice for data scientists world wide.

This is because of language as well as standard and 3rd party library enhancements enabling it to handle
large data sets as well as complex data procssing jobs.

We can all thank the work behind:
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* PyTorch
* keras
* JYthon
* etc.

## Setup

_Note the instructions below are for Linux. Do what is needed for the OS on which you are working._

1. The Python VS Code extension should be installed
1. Create virtual environment - ```python3 -m venv jenv```
1. Activate environment - ```source jenv/bin/activate```
1. Install dependecies - ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Proposed Packages
1. docopt for CLI parsing
1. sqlalchemy for DB ORM
1. NOT sure about pandas - it is interesting, but known to not be performant for how it is used in pandas_etl.py. There are some features that would be useful - selective field consumption. But need to test.
1. bonobo for orchestration
1. NOT airflow
1. jupyter for prototyping!
1. pylint
1. pytest
1. TODO - test progressbar2 package
