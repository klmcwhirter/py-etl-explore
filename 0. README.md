# Python ETL Explore

A place to explore using Python for ETl.

## Overview

When hosted in Linux Docker containers, Python is a valid and reliable choice for ETL work loads.

## Why?

Python is a popular choice for data processing. Much progress has been made to raise Python to a place
where it it has become the languge of choice for data scientists world wide.

This is because of language as well as standard and 3rd party library enhancements enabling it to handle
large data sets as well as complex data procssing jobs.

We can all thank the work behind:
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* PyTorch
* keras
* JYthon
* etc.

## Setup

1. Create virtual environment - ```python3 -m venv jenv```
1. Install pandas - ```pip install pandas```
1. Allow Jupyter dependencies to be intalled when prompted as notebooks are opened
