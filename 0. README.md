# Python ETL Explore

A place to explore using Python for ETl.

## Overview

When hosted in Linux Docker containers, Python is a valid and reliable choice for ETL work loads.

## Why?

> _Enable more junior engineers to do simple tasks, simpler._

Python is a popular choice for data processing. Much progress has been made to raise Python to a place
where it it has become the languge of choice for data scientists world wide.

This is because of language, as well as standard and 3rd party library enhancements enabling it to handle
large data sets as well as complex data procssing jobs.

## Setup for development

_Note the instructions below are for Linux. Do what is needed for the OS on which you are working._

1. The Python VS Code extension should be installed
1. Create virtual environment - ```python3 -m venv venv```
1. Activate environment - ```source venv/bin/activate```
1. Install dependecies - ```pip install --upgrade -r requirements.dev.txt```

## Setup for a prod-like env - just the scripts

_Note the instructions below are for Linux. Do what is needed for the OS on which you are working._

1. Create virtual environment - ```python3 -m venv venv```
1. Activate environment - ```source venv/bin/activate```
1. Install dependecies - ```pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt```
