A place to explore using Python for ETl.


## Running Examples Overview

There are 3 types of executables in this repo.

1. Jupyter notebooks - .ipynb files in Jupyter dir
1. Standalone modules - .py files in the commands dir
1. Flask app hosting API - app.py

## Jupyter Notebooks

Make sure you have created and activated the virtual environment as documented in [0. README](0. README.md).

Open a notebook and select the virtual environment from the drop down in the top right.

Be patient. You may have to wait for the Jupyter server to time out.

## Standalone Modules

Make sure you have created and activated the virtual environment as documented in [0. README](0. README.md).

```bash
$ python3 -m <module_to_execute> [options]
```

For example:
```bash
$ python3 -m commands.bonobo_etl load --verbose --conn=sqlite:///data/outbound/bonobo_weather.db
```


## Flask App

Make sure you have created and activated the virtual environment as documented in [0. README](0. README.md).
